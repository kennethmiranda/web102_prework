## Notes

Challenges encountered while building the app:
On Challenge #2, I got stuck for longer than I would like to admit. This was because I was not getting the correct Secret Key. On Secret Key component 2, the answer is game-container, yet I thought it was all-btn at first because I did not pay attention to the div after. It also took me a bit to realize what Secret Key component 3 was asking me, until I reviewed the CSS Selectors reference and realized it was simply ."class".
